# Zetesis Specification

## Authoring Guidelines
- [REQ-ZE-SPEC-FORMAT] Write requirements as `- [slug] Sentence…` bullets grouped under clear headings. Keep slugs uppercase, hyphen-separated, and project-prefixed (e.g., `ZE-AREA-THEME`).
- [REQ-ZE-SPEC-SCOPE] Document product behavior, constraints, and UX expectations. Leave implementation notes and backlog items for `TODO`.
- [REQ-ZE-SPEC-TRACE] Reference related backlog items with their identifiers (e.g., `WP-CLI`, `T1`) to maintain traceability between `SPEC` and `TODO`.
- [REQ-ZE-SPEC-CHANGES] When requirements change, update the relevant bullet in place and append a short `(Updated YYYY-MM-DD — reason)` note for historical context.
- [REQ-ZE-SPEC-CADENCE] Review SPEC at least once per active sprint; record adjustments immediately so it never trails TODO by more than a day.

### TODO Collaboration
- [REQ-ZE-TODO-SYNC] Before adding or modifying backlog entries, scan the active requirements and ensure each TODO item points to the requirement it satisfies.
- [REQ-ZE-TODO-STATUS] Keep TODO status markers (`[ ]`, `[~]`, `[x]`) in sync with progress and avoid removing completed entries; instead mark them `[x]` for traceability.
- [REQ-ZE-TODO-REVIEWS] When TODO items complete a requirement, annotate the requirement with `(Verified via WP-…/T…)` so SPEC remains the single source of truth.

### Storage & Indexing
- [REQ-ZE-STORAGE-MILLI] Persist canonical structured documents and derived chunk records directly in Milli. Each record must remain self-contained so Milli alone can satisfy read and reindex flows. (Updated 2025-10-30 — migrated away from LMDB-backed document store)
- [REQ-ZE-STORAGE-FS] Store original KIO PDFs on the filesystem using content-addressed paths under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/zetesis/blobs/{silo}/{prefix}/{hash}.pdf`; document records reference the blob location.
- [REQ-ZE-INDEX-PER-SILO] Create one Milli index **per silo** at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/zetesis/milli/{silo}` using Milli’s LMDB-backed environment. Index paths are derived from the silo slug—do not duplicate them elsewhere.
- [REQ-ZE-INDEX-EMBEDDER] Configure each Milli index with vector backend Hannoy and a user-provided embedder defined in configuration (initially `gemini-embedding-001`, dimension 768). Manual vectors must appear under `_vectors.{embedder_key}`.
- [REQ-ZE-INDEX-FIELDS] Chunk documents shall expose flat (or shallow) fields compatible with Milli flattening: `silo`, `doc_type`, `doc_id`, `decision.date` (ISO), `decision.result`, `panel.names[]`, `parties.contracting_authority`, `parties.appellant`, `procurement.cpv_codes`, `section`, `ord`, and `content`. (Updated 2025-10-30 — aligned with Milli canonical storage)
- [REQ-ZE-INDEX-LITERAL] Store per-chunk embeddings only inside Milli; no secondary store may retain vector payloads. (Updated 2025-10-30 — clarified Milli-only vector policy)

### KIO Ingestion
- [REQ-ZE-KIO-INGESTOR] Provide a KIO scraper that enumerates judgments via `POST /Home/GetResults` on https://orzeczenia.uzp.gov.pl/ (Kind=KIO) and walks detail pages for metadata and downloads. The retired FTP flow is not supported. (Updated 2025-10-25 — UZP disabled FTP on 2025-09-30)
- [REQ-ZE-KIO-DISCOVERY] First-page requests must send `CountStats=True` to capture total hits; subsequent pages toggle `CountStats=False` for throughput. The scraper shall respect the portal’s 10-result page limit and advance with `Pg=1..n` using governed retries.
- [REQ-ZE-KIO-CONCURRENCY] Implement a two-stage concurrent pipeline: one async task performs discovery and pushes document descriptors onto a bounded channel; N worker tasks (configurable, default ≥4) pull descriptors and download judgment PDFs plus detail HTML, applying `governor` rate limits and `backon` retries.
- [REQ-ZE-KIO-DOCMETA] For each KIO document, capture multiple case numbers, ruling type (Wyrok/Postanowienie), ISO ruling date, panel names, participant names, procurement subject, case sign, EU journal reference, and extracted legal references before chunking.
- [REQ-ZE-KIO-ASSETS] Persist only the primary judgment body (`/Home/PdfContent/{id}?Kind=KIO`) to the blob store; skip metrics PDFs unless specifically requested later.
- [REQ-ZE-KIO-CHUNKS] Split KIO documents using the double-pass chunker into sections (`header`, `sentencja`, `uzasadnienie`, `other`) with stable ordering; offsets remain attached to chunk metadata inside Milli. (Updated 2025-10-30 — LMDB removed)
- [REQ-ZE-KIO-PIPELINE] The ingest pipeline must: (1) write PDFs to the blob store, (2) persist canonical structured documents in Milli with ingest status `pending`, (3) embed chunks via `ai-ox` Gemini (IO-bounded with governed concurrency), (4) upsert chunk records with `_vectors.{embedder_key}`, and (5) mark the document record `indexed` with counts and timings. (Updated 2025-10-30 — LMDB removed)
- [REQ-ZE-KIO-DELETE] Hard deletes remove Milli documents (doc + chunks) and filesystem blobs in a single operation.
