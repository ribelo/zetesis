Zetesis Execution Backlog — YYYY-MM-DD

Priority legend: P0 = immediate; P1 = next; P2 = later

Legend: [ ] = open · [~] = in progress · [x] = done

## Authoring Checklist
- Start each work package with a stable identifier (e.g., `WP-CLI — Command Surface`) so it can be referenced from `SPEC`.
- Nest work items beneath their work package using `- [ ] ID: description (Pn)` to capture priority and ownership context.
- When progress updates occur, change only the status marker `[ ]/[~]/[x]` and the trailing note; do not reorder completed items.
- Link back to requirements in `SPEC` with parenthetical tags like `(covers REQ-ZE-CLI-FIRST)` for traceability.
- Record handoff notes or follow-ups inline after an em dash (e.g., `— awaiting API keys`) instead of creating new bullets for commentary.
- Revisit TODO daily on active projects; promote new work only after confirming SPEC stays in sync.

## Work Package Template
- WP-NAME — Concise title
